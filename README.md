# FYP_Cardiovascular_Models
Coding for FYP using Windkessel Models of the Cardiovascular system

# University of Sheffield 2023

Windkessel Models are considered 0D because they neglect the streamwise coordinate in blood flow. Models of varying complexity were built and validated, with all code stored in this repository. 

Coding was done in either MATLAB or Simulink.
